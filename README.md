  ## Description
  I built this in order to get a better understanding of using databases, node.js, and creating information through a database. My motivation was to learn more on how to set up a system of questions and answers through node.js. 



  ## Installation
  first you need to right click on index.js and pull up the integrated terminal. secondly you will want to type in node index.js. A series of questions will show for whatever information youre looking for.


  ## Usage
  open integrated terminal by right clicking on index.js, proceeded by typing node index.js
